        Dark Chocolate is a personal favorite. It is rich and full of flavor, without
        being overbearingly sweet or bitter. Goes well with raspberries and almonds.

        White Chocolate offers a very creamy taste of chocolate. Creamy texture melts
        in your mouth as you bite down. Goes great with some almonds or dark chocolate chips.

    We hold our chocolate to the highest standards from the bean to the bar.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the
    journey. We personally check each bar to make sure the coco is of highest
    quality, and that it is helping the farmers and the local environment.
