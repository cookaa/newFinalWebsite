This week we’ll take a look at all the steps required to make astonishing chocolate. The bean goes through many steps, starting out in communities across the world in west Africa and Asia. We communicate with local farmers to get their side of the story, and then will tell you how it is that the cocos are made into the bars.

Learn more here at [Cocoa Growing](https://www.cocoalife.org/in-the-cocoa-origins/a-story-on-farming-cocoa-growing) where they have lots of information on how cocoa is grown. _"Growing cocoa is no simple task"_, and so is included in the the story of how the pods of cocoa are grown

## The Little Secrets of Growing Cocoa

The chocolate that we know has to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is a warm environment, with some love and care. Cocoa beans are the beans off out of pods of the Theobroma cacao, or commonly known as the cocoa tree. Cocoa beans must go through a number of steps before they can be used for chocolate. Here’s a quick list of the important steps they go through:

1. **Growing** Cocoa is delicate, and must be tended. Pods come around year 5.
2. **Harvesting** Pods are harvested twice a year, using steel tools.
3. **Drying** Grows in pods that need to be fermented and dried.
4. **Transporting** Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

Growing these beans is a delicate process, where the
trees have to be sheltered from wind and the sun. They also require fertilization in order to ensure that they grow to full maturity, and can produce fruit. For harvesting, long-handled steel tools in order to cut down the pods without wounding the soft bark of the tree.
A large section of the taste and quality of the beans comes post harvest. Processing of the bean has the biggest impact on the cocoa taste. After the farmer removes the beans from the pods, he then heaps them into piles, and covers them with mats or banana leaves for three to seven days. The layer of pulp that naturally surrounds the beans heats up and ferments the beans, which enhances the cocoa flavor. The beans are then dried in the sun for several days.
