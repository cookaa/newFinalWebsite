We all know that chocolate is delicious, but is it good for us? Something that tastes this good cant possibly help us with motivation and energy. But science says otherwise!
Chocolate has a lot going for it, and has a lot of rich history. Here we will dive more into the history behind chocolate and what makes it so great!

# Not Just Delicious

Although it is typically considered an unhealthy treat, some chocolate does actually have some health benefits. Cocoa beans are rich in natural antioxidants called flavonols. One such flavonol, called epicatechin, can increase the levels of nitric oxide in your blood to relax your blood vessels. This helps to improve blood flow, lower your blood pressure, and can also prevent atherosclerosis, a condition where the arteries harden after becoming clogged with plaque. Epicatechin can also improve your body’s insulin sensitivity, helping to keep your blood sugar levels under control and reduce the risk of diabetes. However, not all chocolate is rich in flavonols. White chocolate is not a good source of these antioxidants as it does not contain cocoa solids, and milk chocolate has a higher proportion of milk and sugar rather than beneficial cocoa. Therefore, dark chocolate is the best option, and the higher the percentage of cocoa solids the better.
