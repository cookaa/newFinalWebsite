We all know that chocolate is delicious, but is it good for us? Something that tastes this good cant possibly help us with motivation and energy. But science says otherwise!
Chocolate has a lot going for it, and has a lot of rich history. Here we will dive more into the history behind chocolate and what makes it so great!

## Not Just Delicious

Although it is typically considered an unhealthy treat, some chocolate does actually have some health benefits. Cocoa beans are rich in natural antioxidants called flavonols. One such flavonol, called epicatechin, can increase the levels of nitric oxide in your blood to relax your blood vessels. This helps to improve blood flow, lower your blood pressure, and can also prevent atherosclerosis, a condition where the arteries harden after becoming clogged with plaque. Epicatechin can also improve your body’s insulin sensitivity, helping to keep your blood sugar levels under control and reduce the risk of diabetes. However, not all chocolate is rich in flavonols. White chocolate is not a good source of these antioxidants as it does not contain cocoa solids, and milk chocolate has a higher proportion of milk and sugar rather than beneficial cocoa. Therefore, dark chocolate is the best option, and the higher the percentage of cocoa solids the better.

## History

Chocolate history finds its origin in the Aztec period. As you will discover from the brief history below chocolate has evolved a lot as it crossed centuries. It was once a bitter drink used in Central America for its strengthening and aphrodisiac effects. It is now a sweet food appreciated in the whole world. It was once a precious foodstuff reserved for royalty and upper class. Now people from any horizon or any age can enjoy chocolate. But there is one point that has never changed throughout history: chocolate has always been a food that has raised a lot of passions.

#1400 BC
In 2007, anthropologists announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back from 1400 BC. The sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.

#12th Century
The Mayan and Aztec cultures have extended in Central and South America.
They both used cocoa beans in religious and sacred rituals. It was also used by the Mayans to trade with other populations.
The Aztecs attributed the creation of the cocoa plant to their god Quetzalcoatl who, descended from heaven on a beam of a morning star carrying a cocoa tree stolen from paradise.
In both the Mayan and Aztec cultures cocoa was the basis for a thick, cold, unsweetened drink called xocoatl considered as a health elixir. Since sugar was unknown to the Aztecs, different spices were used to add flavour, such as musk, cinnamon or hot chili peppers.

#15th Century
1492 - Christopher Columbus brings back a few cacao beans to King Ferdinand. However, they were mostly ignored in favor of the many other treasures he had found.
Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee or Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is a classification of coffee grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. The best lots of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavor and lack of bitterness. Over the past few decades, this coffee has developed a reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and sought-after coffees in the world. Over 80% of all Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In addition to its use for brewed coffee, the beans are the flavor base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur.

Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a globally protected certification mark, meaning only coffee certified by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica can be labeled as such. It comes from a recognized growing region in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica, and its cultivation is monitored by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica.

The Blue Mountains are generally located between Kingston to the south and Port Antonio to the north. Rising 7,402 ft, they are some of the highest mountains in the Caribbean. The climate of the region is cool and misty with high rainfall. The soil is rich, with excellent drainage. This combination of climate and soil is considered ideal for coffee.
