        We believe that good chocolate has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow chocolate lovers and learn about
        chocolate making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our chocolate to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the chocolate’s
